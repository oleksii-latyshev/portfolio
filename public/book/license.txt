This work is based on "Viking book" (https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/viking-book-c23b8c487c3c455cb8ff970a3ec3a5c2) by katrin.kor (https://sketchfab.com/katrin.701) licensed under CC-BY-4.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

Changes: I simplified the model by removing all the textures that were on the pages of the book and also on the book itself. So, from the original, I kept only the model of the book and the basic book texture.
